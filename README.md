## Overview

Thank you for applying for the School of Code bootcamp, and congratulations on taking the first step on your coding journey! Work your way through the activities below to get set up for coding success and build a strong foundation in web development.

If you're successful at obtaining a place on the current cohort of the bootcamp, completing all of the activities in this guide will be essential before day one of the course so that you're up to speed with where the curriculum will start. However, if you aren't able to join us for the current cohort, the activities set out below will still be an invaluable roadmap to begin your coding journey and equip you with the skills you'll need to progress. Also, if you do reapply to School of Code's future cohorts (and we hope that you do!), having gained the knowledge from these activities will be a huge advantage next time.

### Objectives

By the end of this material, you'll be able to:

- Have your development environment (VS Code and other necessary software) set up so you're ready to code
- Understand how information flows over the internet
- Use Markdown, a markup language developers use when documenting and commenting on code
- Use HTML to build a static webpage and CSS to style it
- Start to become acquainted with the basics of JavaScript
- Know the basics of Git and GitHub for version control
- Start navigating through your computer using commands in the command line

## Learning Journey üó∫

### Setting up your development environment to get ready to code

Your IDE (integrated development environment) will be where you write your code during this course, and although there are many options out there, the one we use is Visual Studio Code (usually just referred to as VS Code). VS Code is infinitely customisable with extensions, and it has an integrated terminal, live share, and other handy capabilities that make our coding life easier. Watch [this video](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) to get started with the basics. Then spend some time just familiarising yourself with the program and practice the keyboard shortcuts. You can find a printable shortcut reference [here (Mac)](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) or [here (Windows)](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) or in the home screen of VS Code. You can also find a [searchable reference here](https://vscode-shortcuts.com/).

[This guide](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEhRtVI350/sFbhxfM4nTfe7N4bJu7EnQ/view#1) will help you install VS Code along with the other software you'll need. Follow the instructions on each page that pertain to your operating system.

### How the internet works

What even is the internet? Is it different to the world wide web? How does it actually work? What happens to the information that flows back and forth? These are things we should know if we are going to start building websites, web apps and projects.

We've selected three videos for you to watch from a series of YouTube videos that are a whirlwind tour of everything from early computing to machine learning, robots and more! The three videos we would like you to watch are particularly relevant to the area we will be working in. The aim for us here is to gain an overview of how computers talk to each other. This will help us become more informed about what our code is doing. If you like the series, then feel free to watch more!

### Getting a taste of syntax with Markdown

<img alt="I love markdown" src="./images/i-love-markdown.png" width="200" />

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy) is a lightweight markup language designed to make it easy to write for the web, with an emphasis on being as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible. Developers use it to write documentation about their code and communicate on GitHub around issues and pull requests. The readme you're reading right now is written in Markdown, in fact. It's also used by a lot of tech bloggers to create content. For example, if you wanted to write a post on [dev.to](https://dev.to/), you'd do it in Markdown. In addition to being useful on its own, learning Markdown will help you get used to using different syntax than you might be used to to make things happen on a page, which is good practice for coding! üí™

Follow the [tutorial here](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) to learn the basics of Markdown. You'll have a chance to practice it soon.

### HTML and CSS, the building blocks of the web

Now that your syntax muscles are limbered up, it's time to jump into HTML and CSS, which form the building blocks of the web. HTML stands for "hyper-text markup language", and CSS stands for "cascading style sheets". If a web page was a body, HTML would be its skeleton, the basic structure of the page. ü¶¥ üíÄ CSS would then be the skin, hair, clothes, jewelry, and anything else that falls under the design of the page, how it looks and how it's styled. ü©≥ üëó

FreeCodeCamp is a fantastic resource that makes learning HTML and CSS approachable and fun. Work your way through [the Responsive Web Design activities here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). You can also watch their [Learn HTML5 and CSS3 From Scratch video course here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc).

Alongside FreeCodeCamp, we'd also like you to complete Scrimba's short [Learn UI Design Fundamentals course](https://scrimba.com/learn/design) to help you learn basic design principles that help you create user interfaces with your HTML and CSS that both look good and function well.

### First steps into JavaScript

To continue the body analogy from above, if HTML is the skeleton giving the structure of the page and CSS is what makes it usable and beautiful, JavaScript powers the muscles that allow it to function and do useful things. üí™ However, JavaScript isn't just for the web! JavaScript is a flexible, multi-paradigm language that can run just about anywhere. In fact, according to the oft-quoted [Atwood's Law](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-principle-of-least-power/), "Any application that can be written in JavaScript will eventually be written in JavaScript." Learning JavaScript will empower you to code across the tech spectrum.

Start your JavaScript journey by watching our very own Dr. Chris Meah's [introduction to JavaScript](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8582136) to put things in context and get introduced to the fundamentals. Use the password **bootcamp** to access the video. Then get your hands dirty in JavaScript, progress through the free interactive lessons available in the [JavaScript CodeCademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript). Alongside it, you can supplement your learning further with the [FreeCodeCamp beginner JavaScript video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg).

### Git and version control

The image of the lone coder sitting in a dark corner, nestled under a hooded sweatshirt and tapping away in solitude is a stereotype thanks to countless movies and TV shows, but in reality, coding is a hugely collaborative endeavor. There are loads of benefits to multiple people working on the same codebase, but without a form of version control, the potential for getting wires crossed and overlapping each other's code looms. This is where version control tool comes in to save the day. During the bootcamp, the version control tool you'll be using is called Git. Hand in hand with Git, we'll also be using GitHub (where you're reading this right now), and once you start writing and sharing code in earnest, they'll soon become your best friends!

Follow the [tutorial here](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) to start getting your head around Git and GitHub. Use this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) for a quick reminder of the commands. If things get too complicated, you can use [this site](https://dangitgit.com/en) to help unpick common Git snarls in plain English.

### Taking command with the command line

<img alt="Line Commander" src="./images/line-commander.png" width="500" />

Most users interact with their modern computers using the GUI (graphic user interface) built into their operating system. This means that they can look through their files, open programs, etc. by clicking on icons like folders. üìÅ However, as a programmer, you'll start to use the command line, where you type prompts into a text terminal, to tell your computer what to do directly. ‚å®Ô∏è It might be weird at first, but trust us - when you get used to it, it's much faster!

Learning to navigate a computer using the command line is a skill that gives you lots of power. It will also make you feel like a hacker in a movie. There are a few basic commands to learn first and a lot of more complex ones to learn later on. The important thing for you to take away is the pattern of a using a command, options and input. We've put together [this challenge](https://schoolofcode.github.io/line-commander/) for you to play through which should help you get to grips with the basics and also do some cool stuff!

### Putting it all together - your first projects

TODO: Project description here! (FCC tribute page. Form page too?) FCC projects are in Codepen. Is it reasonable to ask for them to do it in Codepen for FCC's tests and then move it to a GH repo? We can provide the classroom link with starter files to make it easier!

TODO: Ask them to do a readme in MD (the "practice soon" referenced in the MD section above)

By this point, you've done a load of learning, and you might feel like you have lots of different pieces of information swimming around in your head. It's time to solidify what you learned and give you the opportunity for some creativity as well by putting that knowledge into practice.
