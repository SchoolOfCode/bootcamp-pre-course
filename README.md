## Overview

Thank you for applying for the School of Code bootcamp, and congratulations on taking the first step on your coding journey! Work your way through the activities below to get set up for coding success and build a strong foundation in web development.

### Objectives

By the end of this material, you'll be able to:

- Have your development environment (VS Code and other necessary software) set up so you're ready to code
- Understand how information flows over the internet
- Use Markdown, a markup language developers use when documenting and commenting on code
- Use HTML to build a static webpage and CSS to style it
- Start to become acquainted with the basics of JavaScript

## Learning Journey ðŸ—º

### Setting up your development environment to get ready to code

Your IDE (integrated development environment) will be where you write your code during this course, and although there are many options out there, the one we use is Visual Studio Code (usually just referred to as VS Code). VS Code is infinitely customisable with extensions, and it has an integrated terminal, live share, and other handy capabilities that make our coding life easier. Watch [this video](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics) to get started with the basics. Then spend some time just familiarising yourself with the program and practice the keyboard shortcuts. You can find a printable shortcut reference [here (Mac)](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) or [here (Windows)](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) or in the home screen of VS Code. You can also find a [searchable reference here](https://vscode-shortcuts.com/).

After you have your VS Code installed, follow the guide below relevant to your operating system on how to get prepared with all the other necessary software to code during the bootcamp:
